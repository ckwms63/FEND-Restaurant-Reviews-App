GwG Udacity Project 5 FEND Restaurant Reviews App

# Project Overview

This is a project to learn how to convert a static website to a mobile-ready web application with three main requirements:
1. Responsive for different sized displays
2. Accessible for screen reader users
3. Include a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for users

## To run the app:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer using Python. First, check your Python version by entering: python -V.
	* For Python 2.x, you can use: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
	* For Python 3.x, you can use: python3 -m http.server 8000
If you don't have Python installed, visit the [Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instruction to download and install the software.
3. Once your server is running, visit http://localhost:8000

## Notes:
